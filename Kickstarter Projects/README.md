# Kickstarter Projects
Kickstarter is a funding platform for creative projects.Every project creator sets their project's funding goal and deadline. 

If people like the project, they can pledge money to make it happen.If the project succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers' credit cards are charged when time expires. 

Funding on Kickstarter is all-or-nothing. If the project falls short of its funding goal, no one is charged.
